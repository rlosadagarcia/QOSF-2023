# QOSF-Mentorship-Program-Submission

Task 3 QSVM submission for the QC Mentorship program.

Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify the three classes(setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format, the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can use the $UU^{\dagger}$ format or using the [Swap-Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test).
